# How Skyland Recruits

We always seek new ways to build a more humanized, ethical, and fair recruitment process. We've evolved our recruiting strategy by gradually improving it throughout the years. We believe recruitment requires hard work both for us and the candidate and **we make it a win-win** for both sides. If you start your recruitment journey at Skyland, we guarantee you will learn and improve yourself at every step. 

The recruitment process has 4 main steps. Let's deep dive into details for each step.

### Step 1: Technical Interview

If your submission is accepted after evaluating your CV, we organize a zoom meeting as the first step in the process. Two skylanders join from the Skyland side and discuss technical topics for one hour. The discussions mainly around the following areas and technology-stack-related topics.

During the interview, you hear what we expect from a skylander. Also, we hear what you expect to see from a company/culture that motivates you. We inform all the details about the recruitment process and let the candidate has no blur points in its mind.

### Step 2: Challenge Project

If both sides feel happy about the outcome of the first interview, we continue with the second step. At this stage, we send a challenge project to the candidate. We expect to see the challenge finalized in one week. Our aim is not to rush candidates and make them stressed in their busy schedules. Therefore, if candidates ask for extra time, we give them as they want. 

When the project is submitted by the candidate, we evaluate that. If both sides feel to continue with the process, we organize a challenge review meeting via zoom.

### Step 3: Challenge Review

This step aims to review the challenge project with the candidate. Some of software skylanders join this meeting, that is around 3-4 skylanders total. We ask questions to understand the reasons for design decisions made and comment on these. Also, the candidate hears the points skylanders care about. Since the candidate meets with all its possible teammates in one virtual room, it can ask questions at any point to make us clarify. 

We also ask for improving the design by drawing components and diagrams on a virtual whiteboard. That is an intense discussion that usually both sides improve their knowledge. The meeting takes around 1.5 hours.

After the completion, all skylanders come together and analyze the interviews. If all participants strongly agree, we organize the last interview with the CEO of Skyland.

### Step 4: Cultural Interview

This is the last step in our recruitment process. The CEO basically chats with the candidate and tries to understand if the candidate can fit the company from cultural and technical perspectives.
